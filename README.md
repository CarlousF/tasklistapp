Basic iOS Task List App

Fun little iOS App written in Swift. Currently making an iOS application for a Computer Science project, and wanted to try out some Swift programming in XCode first. 

As this was built as a learning exercise, some boilerplate code has been taken from some of the earlier Swift tutorials found online.
